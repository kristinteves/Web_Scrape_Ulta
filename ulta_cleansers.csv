Enriched with vitamins and minerals and organically farmed without pesticides, it's sweet to the taste and to the touch! Sugar is a natural exfoliant. With its grainy texture, it's the perfect ingredient to heighten the scrubbing action that removes dead skin cells, which can clog pores and make your complexion look dull.
