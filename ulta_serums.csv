Alternative products on the market offer suspensions of vitamin C in water-free formulations in heavier silicone bases. These formulations do keep the vitamin C stable but they are almost always offered in heavier silicone bases that interfere with efficient exposure of the entire vitamin C content to the skin (the silicone entraps the vitamin C). This formula avoids the use of heavy silicones to offer better exposure to the vitamin C content.

The Ordinary,"Home,Skin Care,Treatment & Serums,Facial Peels","The Ordinary's Lactic Acid 5% + HA is a mild lactic acid superficial peeling formulation. Lactic Acid is an alpha hydroxyl acid that exfoliates the skin. This 5% formulation offers very mild exfoliation and is supported with a purified Tasmanian pepperberry known to reduce signs of inflammation and sensitivity that is often associated with exfoliation. Tasmanian pepperberry is derivatived to help reduce irritation associated with acid use. This derivative is of plant origin and varies in color seasonally and this color variation may be apparent in the formula from time to time. This pH of this formula is approximately 3.8. Lactic Acid has a pKa of 3.8 and pKa is the most important aspect to consider in formulating with acids. pKa implies acid availability. When pKa is close to pH, there is an ideal balance between salt and acidity, maximizing effectiveness of the acid and reducing irritation. Higher pH numbers in such a case would increase salt which counter-intuitively would make the formula even more irritating than if the formula was more acidic. ,Benefits:,Exfoliates the skin,Improves skin radiance,Cruelty-free & vegan,Formulated without alcohol, oil, silicone, nuts, or gluten,The Ordinary recommends performing a patch test prior to incorporating a new product into your skin care routine. ,Click here to view The Ordinary's Patch Testing Guide., , , Apply once per day, ideally in the PM.

Utilizing a proprietary deep-cleansing, purifying, and resurfacing formula which ""de-gunks"" dead skin cells and ""unglues"" impurities from deep within pores, the The Peach & Lily Super Reboot Resurfacing Mask effectively and gently exfoliates and refines skin.

Because cell turnover slows down as we age, excess sebum traps impurities and clogs pores, leaving dead skin cells and bacteria free to wreak havoc on your face. Keep skin clear from this baggage by optimizing skin cell turnover to help prevent breakouts, improve radiance, produce more collagen and better absorb beneficial ingredients. This powerful proprietary formula delivers a potent way to gently reveal new smooth, soft skin. Meanwhile, Hyaluronic Acid, Centella Asiatica, Chamomile, and Aloe deeply soothe and hydrate.,THE MIND BEHIND: Peach & Lily's founder, Alicia Yoon, is a celebrated esthetician and a leading skincare expert. She's avoided harsh peels and using high levels of glycolic acid on her clients as both can cause skin to become sensitized, reactive or irritated. When it came to developing a new kind of exfoliator, she worked with top labs in Korea on a formula that would offer the upsides of a pro-grade chemical peel without the downsides, namely irritation. It took several hundred formula adjustments to perfect this unique mask packed with ingredients that simultaneously resurface skin while also soothing, and nourishing. Take it from her, when your skin is being clarified of impurities, it's the perfect time for it to absorb beneficial ingredients. Even those with sensitive skin will enjoy a baby-soft new complexion, with zero downtime.,THE PEACH & LILY PROMISE: Caring for your skin can be overwhelming.
